  <p>RDF [[RDF-CONCEPTS]] describes a graph-based data model for making claims

    of information. At times, it becomes necessary to compare the differences
    between sets of graphs, digitally sign them, or generate short identifiers

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>When data scientists discuss normalization, they do so in the context of
    achieving a particular set of goals. Since the same information may
    sometimes be expressed in a variety of different ways, it often becomes
    necessary to be able to transform each of these different ways into a
    single, standard format. With a standard format, the differences between
    two different sets of data can be easily determined, a
    cryptographically-strong hash identifier can be generated for a particular
    set of data, and a particular set of data may be digitally-signed for later
    verification.</p>

  <p>In particular, this specification is about normalizing
    <a>RDF datasets</a>, which are collections of graphs. Since
    a directed graph can express the same information in more than one
    way, it requires normalization to achieve the aforementioned goals
    and any others that may arise via serendipity.</p>

  <p>Most <a>RDF datasets</a> can be normalized fairly quickly, in terms
    of algorithmic time complexity. However, those that contain nodes that do
    not have globally unique identifiers pose a greater challenge. Normalizing
    these datasets presents the <dfn>graph isomorphism</dfn> problem, a
    problem that is believed to be difficult to solve quickly. More formally,
    it is believed to be an NP-Intermediate problem, that is, neither known to
    be solvable in polynomial time nor NP-complete. Fortunately, existing real
    world data is rarely modeled in a way that manifests this problem and new
    data can be modeled to avoid it. In fact, software systems can detect a
    problematic dataset and may choose to assume it's an attempted denial of
    service attack, rather than a real input, and abort.</p>

  <p>This document outlines an algorithm for generating a normalized
    <a>RDF dataset</a> given an <a>RDF dataset</a> as input. The
    algorithm is called the
    <strong>Universal RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm 2015</strong> or
    <strong>URDNA2015</strong>.</p>

  <div class="issue" data-number="2"></div>
  <section>
    <h2>Uses of Dataset Normalization</h2>
    <p>There are different use cases where graph or dataset normalization are important:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Determining if one serialization is isomorphic to another.</li>
      <li>Digital signing of graphs (datasets) independent of serialization or format.</li>
      <li>Comparing two graphs (datasets) to find differences.</li>
      <li>Communicating change sets when remotely updating an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-rdf-source" class="externalDFN">RDF source</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A normalization algorithm is necessary, but not necessarily sufficient, to handle many of these use cases. The use of <a>blank nodes</a> in RDF graphs and datasets has a long history and creates inevitable complexities. Blank nodes are used for different purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>when a well known identifier for a node is not known, or the author of a document chooses not to unambiguously name that node,</li>
      <li>when a node is used to stitch together parts of a graph and the nodes themselves are not interesting (e.g., <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/#rdf-collections" class="externalDFN">RDF Collections</a> in [[RDF-MT]]),</li>
      <li>when someone is trying to create an intentionally difficult graph topology.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Further more, RDF semantics dictate that deserializing the same RDF document results in the creation of unique <a>blank nodes</a>, unless it can be determined that on each occasion, the <a>blank node identifiers</a> the same resource; this is due to the fact that <a>blank node identifiers</a> are an aspect of a concrete RDF syntax and are not intended to be persistent or portable. Within the abstract RDF model, blank nodes do not have identifiers (although some <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/index.html#dfn-rdf-store" class="externalDFN">RDF store</a> implementations may use stable identifiers and choose to make them portable). See <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/index.html#section-blank-nodes">Blank Nodes</a></cite> in [[!RDF-CONCEPTS]] for more information.</p>
    <p>RDF does have a provision for allowing blank nodes to be published in an externally identifiable way through the use of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/index.html#dfn-skolem-iri" class="externalDFN">Skolem IRIs</a>, which allows a given RDF store to replace the use of blank nodes in a concrete syntax with IRIs, which serve to repeatably identify that blank node within that particular RDF store, however, this is not generally useful for talking about the same graph in different RDF stores, or other concrete representations. In any case, a stable <a>blank node identifier</a> defined for one RDF store, serialization is arbitrary, and typically not relatable to the context within which it is used.</p>
    <p>This specification defines an algorithm for creating stable <a>blank node identifiers</a> repeatably for different serializations possibly using individualized <a>blank node identifiers</a> of the same RDF graph (dataset) by grounding each <a>blank node</a> through the nodes to which it is connected, essentially creating <em>Skolem <a>blank node identifiers</a></em>. As a result, a graph signature can be obtained by hashing a canonical serialization of the resulting <a>normalized dataset</a>, allowing for the isomorphism and digital signing use cases. As blank node identifiers can be stable even with other changes to a graph (dataset), in some cases it is possible to compute the difference between two graphs (datasets), for example if changes are made only to ground triples, or if new blank nodes are introduced which do not create an automorphic confusion with other existing blank nodes. If any information which would change the generated blank node identifier, a resulting diff might indicate a greater set of changes than actually exists.</p>

  <h2>Normalization</h2>

  <p>Normalization is the process of transforming an
    <a>input dataset</a> to a <a>normalized dataset</a>. That
    is, any two <a>input datasets</a> that contain the same
    information, regardless of their arrangement, will be transformed into
    identical <a>normalized dataset</a>. The problem requires directed
    graphs to be deterministically ordered into sets of nodes and edges. This
    is easy to do when all of the nodes have globally-unique identifiers, but
    can be difficult to do when some of the nodes do not. Any nodes without
    globally-unique identifiers must be issued deterministic identifiers.</p>

  <p class="ednote">Strictly speaking, the normalized dataset must be serialized to be stable, as within a dataset, blank node identifiers have no meaning. This specification defines a <a>normalized dataset</a> to include stable identifiers for blank nodes, but practical uses of this will always generate a canonical serialization of such a dataset.</p>

  <p>In time, there may be more than one normalization algorithm and,
    therefore, for identification purposes, this algorithm is named the
    "Universal RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm 2015"
    (<abbr title="Universal RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm 2015"><dfn>URDNA2015</dfn></abbr>).</p>

  <p class="ednote">This statement is overly prescriptive and does not include normative language.
    This spec should describe the theoretical basis for graph normalization and describe
    behavior using normative statements. The explicit algorithms should follow as an informative appendix.</p>

    <h2>Blank Node Identifier Issuer State</h2>

    <p>During the normalization algorithm, it is sometimes necessary to
      issue new identifiers to <a>blank nodes</a>. The
      <a href="#issue-identifier-algorithm">Issue Identifier algorithm</a> uses an
      <a>identifier issuer</a> to accomplish this task. The information
      an <a>identifier issuer</a> needs to keep track of is described

      <dd>The identifier prefix is a string that is used at the beginning of an
        <a>blank node identifier</a>. It should be initialized to a
        string that is specified by the normalization algorithm. When
        generating a new <a>blank node identifier</a>, the prefix
        is concatenated with a <a>identifier counter</a>. For example,
        <code>_:c14n</code> is a proper initial value for the
        <a>identifier prefix</a> that would produce
        <a>blank node identifiers</a> like <code>_:c14n1</code>.</dd>

      <dd>A counter that is appended to the <a>identifier prefix</a> to

      <dt><dfn>issued identifiers list</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A list that tracks previously issued identifiers in the order in
        which they were issued. It also tracks the existing identifier that
        triggered the issuance, to prevent issuing more than one new identifier
        per existing identifier, and to allow <a>blank nodes</a> to
        be reassigned identifiers some time after issuance.</dd>

    <h2>Normalization Algorithm</h2>

    <p>The normalization algorithm converts an <a>input dataset</a>
      into a <a>normalized dataset</a>. This algorithm will assign
      deterministic identifiers to any <a>blank nodes</a> in the
      <a>input dataset</a>.</p>

    <p class="ednote">Documenting the algorithm is a WIP, various steps will
      become more detailed in time.</p>

    <h2>Hash N-Degree Quads</h2>

    <p class="ednote">The relationship and difference between this algorithm
      and the hash first degree quads algorithm should be better explained.
      There may also be better names for the two algorithms.</p>

    <p class="ednote">The 'path' terminology could also be changed to better
      indicate what a path is (a particular deterministic serialization for
      a subgraph/subdataset of nodes without globally-unique identifiers).</p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>Usually, when trying to determine if two nodes in a graph are
        equivalent, you simply compare their identifiers. However, what if the
        nodes don't have identifiers? Then you must determine if the two nodes
        have equivalent connections to equivalent nodes all throughout the
        whole graph. This is called the graph isomorphism problem. This
        algorithm approaches this problem by considering how one might draw
        a graph on paper. You can test to see if two nodes are equivalent
        by drawing the graph twice. The first time you draw the graph the
        first node is drawn in the center of the page. If you can draw the
        graph a second time such that it looks just like the first, except
        the second node is in the center of the page, then the nodes are
        equivalent. This algorithm essentially defines a deterministic way to
        draw a graph where, if you begin with a particular node, the graph
        will always be drawn the same way. If two graphs are drawn the same way
        with two different nodes, then the nodes are equivalent. A
        <a>hash</a> is used to indicate a particular way that the graph
        has been drawn and can be used to compare nodes.</p>

      <p>This algorithm works in concert with the main normalization algorithm
        to produce a unique, deterministic identifier for a particular blank
        node. This <a>hash</a> incorporates all of the information that
        is connected to the blank node as well as how it is connected. It does
        this by creating deterministic paths that emanate out from the blank
        node through any other adjacent blank nodes.</p>

  <h2>URGNA2012</h2>
  <p>A previous version of this algorithm has light deployment. For purposes of identification,
    the algorithm is called the
    "Universal RDF Graph Normalization Algorithm 2012"
    (<abbr title="Universal RDF Graph Normalization Algorithm 2012"><dfn>URGNA2012</dfn></abbr>),
    and differs from the stated algorithm in the following ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In <a href="#hash-first-degree-quads" class="sectionRef"></a>, if any blank node was used in the <a>graph name</a>
      position in the <a>quad</a>, then the value was serialized using
      the special <a>blank node identifier</a>, <code>_:g</code>, instead of <code>_:z</code>.</li>
    <li>In <a href="#hash-related-blank-node" class="sectionRef"></a>, value of the <a>predicate</a>
      was not delimited by <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>; there
      were no delimiters.</li>
    <li>In <a href="#hash-n-degree-quads" class="sectionRef"></a>, the <var>position</var> parameter passed to
      the <a href="#hash-related-blank-node">Hash Related Blank Node algorithm</a>
      was instead modeled as a <var>direction</var> parameter, where it could have
      the value <code>p</code>, for property, when the related blank node was a
      <a>subject</a> and the value <code>r</code>, for reverse or reference, when
      the related blank node was an <a>object</a>. Since URGNA2012 only normalized
      graphs, not datasets, there was no use of the <a>graph name</a> position.</li>
    <li>In <a href="#hash-n-degree-quads" class="sectionRef"></a>, building the
      <var>hash to related blank nodes map</var> was done as follows:
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>For each <var>quad</var> in <var>quads</var>:
          <ol class="algorithm">
            <li>If the <var>quad</var>'s <a>subject</a> is a <a>blank node</a> that does not
              match <var>identifier</var>, set <var>hash</var> to the result of the
                <a href="#hash-related-blank-node">Hash Related Blank Node algorithm</a>,
                passing the <a>blank node identifier</a> for
                <a>subject</a> as <var>related</var>, <var>quad</var>,
                <var>path identifier issuer</var> as <var>issuer</var>, and
                <code>p</code> as <var>position</var>.
            </li>
            <li>Otherwise, if <var>quad</var>'s <a>object</a> is a <a>blank node</a> that does
              not match <var>identifier</var>, set <var>hash</var> to the result of the
                <a href="#hash-related-blank-node">Hash Related Blank Node algorithm</a>,
                passing the <a>blank node identifier</a> for
                <a>object</a> as <var>related</var>, <var>quad</var>,
                <var>path identifier issuer</var> as <var>issuer</var>, and
                <code>r</code> as <var>position</var>.
            </li>
            <li>Otherwise, continue to the next quad.</li>
            <li>Add a mapping of <var>hash</var> to the
              <a>blank node identifier</a> for the component
              that matched (<a>subject</a> or <a>object</a>) to
              <var>hash to related blank nodes map</var>, adding an entry
              as necessary.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
