  <p>RDF [[RDF-CONCEPTS]] describes a graph-based data model for making claims

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>When data scientists discuss normalization, they do so in the context of
    achieving a particular set of goals. Since the same information may
    sometimes be expressed in a variety of different ways, it often becomes
    necessary to be able to transform each of these different ways into a
    single, standard format. With a standard format, the differences between
    two different sets of data can be easily determined, a
    cryptographically-strong hash identifier can be generated for a particular
    set of data, and a particular set of data may be digitally-signed for later
    verification.</p>

  <p>In particular, this specification is about normalizing
    <a title="rdf dataset">RDF datasets</a>, which are collections of graphs. Since
    a directed graph can express the same information in more than one
    way, it requires normalization to achieve the aforementioned goals
    and any others that may arise via surrendipity.</p>

  <p>Most <a title="rdf dataset">RDF datasets</a> can be normalized fairly quickly, in terms
    of algorithmic time complexity. However, those that contain nodes that do
    not have globally unique identifiers pose a greater challenge. Normalizing
    these datasets presents the <dfn>graph isomorphism</dfn> problem, a
    problem that is believed to be difficult to solve quickly. More formally,
    it is believed to be an NP-Intermediate problem, that is, neither known to
    be solvable in polynomial time nor NP-complete. Fortunately, existing real
    world data is rarely modeled in a way that manifests this problem and new
    data can be modeled to avoid it. In fact, software systems can detect a
    problematic dataset and may choose to assume it's an attempted denial of
    service attack, rather than a real input, and abort.</p>

  <p>This document outlines an algorithm for generating a normalized
    <a>RDF dataset</a> given an <a>RDF dataset</a> as input. The
    algorithm is called the
    <strong>Universal RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm 2015</strong> or
    <strong>URDNA2015</strong>.</p>

  <h1>Normalization</h1>

  <p>Normalization is the process of transforming an
    <a>input RDF dataset</a> to a <a>normalized RDF dataset</a>. That
    is, any two <a title="input rdf dataset">input RDF datasets</a> that contain the same
    information, regardless of their arrangement, will be transformed into
    identical <a title="normalized rdf dataset">normalized RDF dataset</a>. The problem requires directed
    graphs to be deterministically ordered into sets of nodes and edges. This
    is easy to do when all of the nodes have globally-unique identifiers, but
    can be difficult to do when some of the nodes do not. Any nodes without
    globally-unique identifiers must be issued deteriministic identifiers.</p>

  <p>In time, there may be more than one normalization algorithm and,
    therefore, for identification purposes, this algorithm is named the
    "Universal RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm 2015"
    (<abbr title="Universal RDF Dataset Normalization Algorithm 2015">URDNA2015</abbr>).</p>

    <h1>Normalization State</h1>

    <p>When performing the steps required by the normalization algorithm,
      it is helpful to track state in a data structure called the
      <dfn>normalization state</dfn>. The information contained in the
      <a>normalization state</a> is described below.</p>

  <section>
    <h1>Blank Node Identifier Issuer State</h1>

    <p>During the normalization algorithm, it is sometimes necessary to
      issue new identifiers to <a title="rdf blank node">RDF blank nodes</a>. The
      <a href="#issue-identifier-algorithm">Issue Identifier algorithm</a> uses an
      <a>identifier issuer</a> to accomplish this task. The information
      an <a>identifier issuer</a> needs to keep track of is described
      below.</p>

      <dt><dfn>identifier prefix</dfn></dt>
      <dd>The identifier prefix is a string that is used at the beginning of an
        <a>RDF blank node identifier</a>. It should be initialized to a
        string that is specified by the normalization algorithm. When
        generating a new <a>RDF blank node identifier</a>, the prefix
        is concatenated with a <a>identifier counter</a>. For example,
        <code>_:c14n</code> is a proper initial value for the
        <a>identifier prefix</a> that would produce
        <a title="rdf blank node identifier">RDF blank node identifiers</a> like <code>_:c14n1</code>.</dd>

      <dd>A counter that is appended to the <a>identifier prefix</a> to

      <dt><dfn>issued identifiers list</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A list that tracks previously issued identifiers in the order in
        which they were issued. It also tracks the existing identifier that
        triggered the issuance, to prevent issuing more than one new identifier
        per existing identifier, and to allow <a title="rdf blank node">RDF blank nodes</a> to
        be reassigned identifiers some time after issuance.</dd>

    <h2>Normalization Algorithm</h2>

    <h2>Hash N-Degree Quads</h2>

    <p class="issue">The relationship and difference between this algorithm
      and the hash first degree quads algorithm should be better explained.
      There may also be better names for the two algorithms.</p>

    <p class="issue">The 'path' terminology could also be changed to better
      indicate what a path is (a particular deterministic serialization for
      a subgraph/subdataset of nodes without globally-unique identifiers).</p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>Usually, when trying to determine if two nodes in a graph are
        equivalent, you simply compare their identifiers. However, what if the
        nodes don't have identifiers? Then you must determine if the two nodes
        have equivalent connections to equivalent nodes all throughout the
        whole graph. This is called the graph isomorphism problem. This
        algorithm approaches this problem by considering how one might draw
        a graph on paper. You can test to see if two nodes are equivalent
        by drawing the graph twice. The first time you draw the graph the
        first node is drawn in the center of the page. If you can draw the
        graph a second time such that it looks just like the first, except
        the second node is in the center of the page, then the nodes are
        equivalent. This algorithm essentially defines a determinitsic way to
        draw a graph where, if you begin with a particular node, the graph
        will always be drawn the same way. If two graphs are drawn the same way
        with two different nodes, then the nodes are equivalent. A
        <a>hash</a> is used to indicate a particular way that the graph
        has been drawn and can be used to compare nodes.</p>

      <p>This algorithm works in concert with the main normalization algorithm
        to produce a unique, deterministic identifier for a particular blank
        node. This <a>hash</a> incorporates all of the information that
        is connected to the blank node as well as how it is connected. It does
        this by creating deterministic paths that emanate out from the blank
        node through any other adjacent blank nodes.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Algorithm</h3>

      <p>The inputs to this algorithm are the <a>normalization state</a>,
        the <i>identifier</i> for the <a>RDF blank node</a> to
        recursively hash quads for, and path identifier <i>issuer</i> which is
        an <a>identifier issuer</a> that issues temporary
        <a>RDF blank node identifier</a>s. The output from this algorithm
        will be a <a>hash</a> and the <a>identifier issuer</a> used
        to help generate it.</p>

      <p class="issue">In URGNA2012, the <i>position</i> parameter passed to
        the <a href="#hash-related-blank-node">Hash Related Blank Node algorithm</a>
        was instead modeled as a <i>direction</i> parameter, where it could have
        the value <code>p</code>, for property, when the related blank node was a
        `subject` and the value <code>r</code>, for reverse or reference, when
        the related blank node was an `object`. Since URGNA2012 only normalized
        graphs, not datasets, there was no use of the `graph` position.</p>
